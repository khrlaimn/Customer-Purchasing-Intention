## **Customer's Purchasing Intention**

This project aims to predict and classify customers' purchasing intentions using the Online Shoppers Purchasing Intention Dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The project involves data preprocessing, feature engineering, and modeling with various algorithms such as Random Forest, Logistic Regression, and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN). Additionally, hyperparameter tuning is performed using GridSearchCV and RandomizedSearchCV, and the model performance is assessed through various metrics and visualizations.
